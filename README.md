Deprecated functionality due to google authentication:
Under any module cannot add new users because the password for logging in will be generated randomly and sent in mail for the user. But due to google`s authentication the I`m unable to send the mail. But the new user will be created if you check in the database. Problem is password because it will be hashed, I cannot know that password. Feel free to write me regarding this issue.
